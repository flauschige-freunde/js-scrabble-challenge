2. Create a function to get each letter from a given word

3. Create a function to call the object of letters and return the values for all letters and store them in an array

4. Create a function to sum up the values of the array with array methodes return the sum

5. Check for edge cases (null, empty characters, funny ascii characters ...)

6. Add {} [] to the letter object with values of 2 & 3.

7. Add a "modifier" variable to multiply each character of the letter array with.

8. Create yet another function to calculate to letter sum with the modifier. Return the sum. Modify the previous function "3".

9. Modify the previous function "3" to calculate the entire word first and apply the modifier after that.

10. For nested multipliers: modify function 3 and 4 to add modified single characters after the entire word calculation.
